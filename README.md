Babmeo Project
- Babmeo is an image & video sharing site
with transparent recommendations.
- The service integrates with DFINITY’s LinkedUp, BigMap, and BigSearch projects to recommend, store, and search videos.
- We will be deploying on the Tungsten network, where DFINITY’s distributed network will run the app and store user data.
